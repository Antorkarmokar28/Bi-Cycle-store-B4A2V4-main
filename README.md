# Bi-Cycle-store-B4A2V4

This is a NSQL backend project. This project name **Bi-Cycle-store-B4A2V4.** This is a bicycle store product related backend project. I used **Express**, **Mongoose**, **Typescript** and **mongodb uri** in this project. I ensured data integrity using Mongoose schema validation and I used **cors** for middleware in this project. For the .env file I used **dotenv**. I used **ts-node-dev** because It restarts target node process when any of required files changes and I used **eslint** to fix errors in my code and I used **.prettierrc** to keep the code format correct.
